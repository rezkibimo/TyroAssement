# Tyro Graduate Assessment

I have invited you to the Postman workspace. However, I also have provided the file to be imported manually to Postman. Just import both JSON files. It should works

Assumptions:
•Required to use the GET instead of POST
•Ideal API respond time is 250ms
•Using the https://public.cdr.tyro.com/cds-au/v1/banking/products instead of https://api.cdr.tyro.com/cds-au/v1/banking/products
•Allowed to use a random array generator to simulate the ERROR 400
•Force HTTPS and Cookies disabled

Pre-requisites:
•Tyro OpenAPI specification from the website
•Postman

Issues found/faced:
•The API service was down for the whole day so needed to wait for the API service to be restored
•Need to fidget around since Postman Github Sync is only available to paid user
